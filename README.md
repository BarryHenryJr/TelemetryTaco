## 🚀 Quick Start

> **New to the project?** Start here! For detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting, see the sections below.

### Fastest Way to Start (Recommended)

After initial setup, start everything with one command:

**First time setup** (make scripts executable):

```bash
chmod +x start.sh stop.sh
```

**Then start everything:**

```bash
# Option 1: Using the startup script (easiest)
./start.sh

# Option 2: Using pnpm
pnpm start

# Option 3: Using Make
make dev

# To stop all services:
./stop.sh  # or: pnpm stop  # or: make stop
```

The startup script will:

1. ✅ Start Docker services (PostgreSQL & Redis)
2. ✅ Wait for PostgreSQL to be ready
3. ✅ Create `.env` file if missing
4. ✅ Run database migrations
5. ✅ Start Django backend server (background)
6. ✅ Start Celery worker (background)
7. ✅ Start frontend dev server (foreground)

**Access the application:**

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/api/docs

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.11 or 3.12 (for local development)
- Poetry (for Python dependency management)
- Node.js 18+ & pnpm (for frontend development)

### Manual Setup (Step-by-Step)

If you prefer to start services manually or the startup script doesn't work:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TelemetryTaco.git
cd TelemetryTaco

# 1. Start database and Redis services
docker-compose up -d db redis

# 2. Wait 5-10 seconds for PostgreSQL to initialize, then verify:
docker-compose ps db  # Should show "Up" and "healthy"

# 3. Set up backend (in backend/ directory)
cd backend
poetry env use python3.11  # Required if you have Python 3.14+
poetry install

# 4. Generate a secure SECRET_KEY and create .env file
# First, generate a secure SECRET_KEY:
python3 -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'

# Copy the generated key, then create .env file (replace YOUR_SECRET_KEY with the generated key)
# Check your Docker container credentials first:
# docker-compose exec db env | grep POSTGRES
cat > .env << 'EOF'
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/telemetry_taco
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0
EOF
# Replace YOUR_SECRET_KEY with the generated key from above
# Update DATABASE_URL if your Docker container uses different credentials

# 5. Test database connection
poetry run python check_db.py

# 6. Run migrations
poetry run python manage.py migrate

# 7. Start backend server
poetry run python manage.py runserver
# Backend will be available at http://localhost:8000

# 8. In another terminal, start Celery worker
cd backend
poetry run celery -A core worker --loglevel=info

# 9. In another terminal, start frontend
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# Frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend API: http://localhost:8000
# API Docs: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
```

**Note**: For full Docker deployment (all services in containers), see `docker-compose.yml`. The above setup is recommended for local development.

### Development Commands Reference

After initial setup, use these commands for daily development:

```bash
# Start everything (recommended)
./start.sh          # or: pnpm start  # or: make dev

# Start individual services
pnpm dev:frontend   # Frontend only
pnpm dev:backend    # Backend only
pnpm dev:worker     # Celery worker only
pnpm services       # Docker services only

# Database operations
pnpm migrate        # Run migrations
make migrate        # Alternative

# Stop services
./stop.sh           # or: pnpm stop  # or: make stop

# View all Make commands
make help
```

**Note**: On first run, make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x start.sh stop.sh
```

### Local Development

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Configure Poetry to use Python 3.11 (required if you have Python 3.14+)
poetry env use python3.11
# Or specify full path: poetry env use /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11

# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install

# Set up environment variables
# First, generate a secure SECRET_KEY:
python3 -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'

# Create .env file in backend/ directory (replace YOUR_SECRET_KEY with the generated key)
cat > .env << 'EOF'
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/telemetry_taco
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0
EOF
# Replace YOUR_SECRET_KEY with the generated key from above

# Note: If your Docker PostgreSQL uses different credentials, update DATABASE_URL accordingly.
# Important: The SECRET_KEY must be at least 50 characters and cannot use example/insecure values.
# Check your Docker container: docker-compose exec db env | grep POSTGRES

# Start database and Redis (from project root)
cd ..
docker-compose up -d db redis

# Wait 5-10 seconds for PostgreSQL to initialize, then verify:
docker-compose ps db

# Test database connection
cd backend
poetry run python check_db.py

# Run migrations
poetry run python manage.py migrate

# Start Django server
poetry run python manage.py runserver

# In another terminal, start Celery worker
cd backend
poetry run celery -A core worker --loglevel=info
```

**Troubleshooting**: If you encounter database connection issues, see [Backend Setup Guide](backend/SETUP.md) for detailed troubleshooting steps.

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
# The Vite dev server is configured to proxy /api/* requests to http://localhost:8000
pnpm dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and will automatically proxy API requests to the backend.

### Using the SDK

```python
# Option 1: Direct import (for development)
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'path/to/TelemetryTaco/sdk')
from telemetry_taco import TelemetryTaco

# Option 2: Install as package (recommended)
# pip install -e ./sdk
# from telemetry_taco import TelemetryTaco

# Initialize client
client = TelemetryTaco(base_url="http://localhost:8000")

# Capture an event (non-blocking)
client.capture(
    distinct_id="user_123",
    event_name="feature_used",
    properties={
        "feature_name": "dark_mode",
        "page": "settings",
        "system_health": {
            "cpu_usage": 45.2,
            "memory_usage": 62.1
        }
    }
)

# Use context manager to ensure events are sent before exit
with TelemetryTaco(base_url="http://localhost:8000") as client:
    client.capture(distinct_id="user_123", event_name="page_view")
    # Events are automatically flushed on exit
```

## 🤔 Why Async?

TelemetryTaco decouples **event ingestion** from **event processing** to achieve optimal performance and reliability.

### The Problem

Traditional synchronous architectures force API endpoints to wait for database writes, creating several issues:

- **High Latency**: Database writes (especially with indexes) can take 50-200ms, directly impacting API response times
- **Poor Scalability**: Database connections become a bottleneck under high load
- **Single Point of Failure**: If the database is slow or unavailable, the entire API becomes unresponsive
- **No Backpressure Handling**: Sudden traffic spikes can overwhelm the database

### The Solution

By using Redis as a message broker and Celery for async processing:

1. **API Returns Immediately** - Endpoints respond in <10ms, regardless of database load
2. **Independent Scaling** - API servers and Celery workers scale independently based on their specific bottlenecks
3. **Resilience** - If the database is temporarily unavailable, events queue in Redis and process when it recovers
4. **Rate Limiting** - Redis can handle millions of operations per second, providing natural backpressure
5. **Idempotency** - UUID-based deduplication in Celery tasks prevents duplicate processing

### Performance Characteristics

| Metric                  | Synchronous       | Async (TelemetryTaco) |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| API Response Time       | 50-200ms          | <10ms                 |
| Throughput (events/sec) | ~1,000            | 10,000+               |
| Database Load           | High (blocking)   | Controlled (batched)  |
| Failure Recovery        | Immediate failure | Graceful degradation  |

## 📈 Scaling Path

TelemetryTaco is designed with a clear migration path from MVP to production scale, following proven patterns from [PostHog](https://posthog.com) and other high-scale telemetry platforms.

### Phase 1: PostgreSQL JSONB (Current)

**Use Case**: < 1M events/day, single region, real-time queries

**Architecture**:

- PostgreSQL with JSONB columns for event properties
- GIN indexes on JSONB fields for efficient querying
- Single PostgreSQL instance with read replicas for scaling reads

**Advantages**:

- ✅ Simple setup and operations
- ✅ ACID guarantees for data consistency
- ✅ Excellent for complex queries and aggregations
- ✅ No additional infrastructure required

**Limitations**:

- ⚠️ Write throughput limited to ~10K events/sec per instance
- ⚠️ JSONB query performance degrades with large datasets
- ⚠️ Storage costs grow linearly with event volume

### Phase 2: ClickHouse Migration (Future)

**Use Case**: > 10M events/day, multi-region, analytical workloads

**Architecture**:

- **Dual-Write Pattern**: Write to both PostgreSQL (for real-time) and ClickHouse (for analytics)
- **Event Router**: Celery task writes to both systems in parallel
- **Query Router**: Frontend queries PostgreSQL for recent data (< 24h), ClickHouse for historical
- **Eventual Consistency**: ClickHouse may lag by seconds, but provides 100x better query performance

**Migration Strategy**:

```python
# Example: Dual-write pattern in Celery task
@shared_task
def process_event_task(event_data: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    # Write to PostgreSQL (real-time queries)
    Event.objects.create(**event_data)

    # Write to ClickHouse (analytical queries)
    clickhouse_client.insert('events', [event_data])
```

**ClickHouse Advantages**:

- ✅ **Columnar Storage**: 10-100x compression vs row-based storage
- ✅ **Query Performance**: Sub-second queries on billions of events
- ✅ **Horizontal Scaling**: Shard across multiple nodes
- ✅ **Time-Series Optimized**: Built-in functions for time-based aggregations
- ✅ **Cost Effective**: ~$0.01 per million events stored

**PostHog Architecture Reference**:

- PostHog uses ClickHouse for events table, PostgreSQL for metadata
- Events are immutable, append-only writes only
- Partitioning by date for efficient data retention policies
- Materialized views for common aggregations (daily/weekly/monthly)

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations

**Partitioning Strategy**:

- Partition ClickHouse tables by date (daily partitions)
- Automatic TTL policies for data retention
- Hot/warm storage tiers (SSD for recent, HDD for historical)

**Query Optimization**:

- Materialized views for pre-computed aggregations
- Sampling for exploratory queries on large datasets
- Approximate algorithms (HyperLogLog) for distinct counts

**Multi-Region**:

- Regional ClickHouse clusters with replication
- Event routing based on user geography
- Cross-region aggregation for global insights

### Migration Checklist

When to migrate to ClickHouse:

- [ ] Event volume exceeds 1M events/day consistently
- [ ] Query performance degrades (> 5s for aggregations)
- [ ] Storage costs become significant (> $500/month)
- [ ] Need for complex analytical queries (cohorts, funnels, retention)
- [ ] Multi-region deployment requirements

### Troubleshooting

#### Database Connection Issues

If you see "password authentication failed" errors:

1. **Check Docker PostgreSQL is running:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps db
   ```

2. **Verify database credentials:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec db env | grep POSTGRES
   ```

3. **Update `.env` file** in `backend/` with correct credentials:

   ```bash
   # The DATABASE_URL should match the credentials from step 2
   # Format: postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/telemetry_taco
   ```

4. **Test connection using the diagnostic script:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   poetry run python check_db.py
   ```

For more detailed troubleshooting, see [Backend Setup Guide](backend/SETUP.md).

#### Python Version Issues

If Poetry fails with Python version errors:

1. **Check your Python version:**

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **Configure Poetry to use Python 3.11:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   poetry env use python3.11
   # Or: poetry env use /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11
   ```

3. **Reinstall dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

#### Frontend Connection Issues

If you see "Failed to fetch" errors in the browser:

1. **Verify backend is running** on `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Check Vite proxy configuration** in `frontend/vite.config.ts`
3. **Verify CORS settings** in `backend/telemetry_taco/settings.py`
4. **Restart frontend dev server** after backend changes
